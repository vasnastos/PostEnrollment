# PostEnrollment Timetabling Problem

**The timetabling problem has many variations such as educational timetabling, nurse rostering, sports timetabling, employee timetabling, and transport timetabling. Here, we focused on educational timetabling, in specific, the university timetabling problem that has been studied extensively through the years due to its wide range of applications. University timetabling problems can be divided into examination timetabling and course timetabling problem (UCTP). The latter is divided into two subcategories: post-enrollment-based course timetabling [3], which implies the assignment of lecture events to time slots and rooms, and curriculum-based course timetabling, which deals with the weekly assignment of a set of lectures for various university courses to specific time slots and rooms.**
